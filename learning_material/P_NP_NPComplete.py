# NP is the class of all search problems. The NP problems have solution and it is possible to verify the solution in guaranteed polynomial time.
# NP is articulating as general way as possible
#
# P problens are solved in polynomial time. P=NP is a computational analog to automating creativity.
# It is a lot more diffucult to create something than check this is good. Einstein created a theory, someone can verify it.
# if P==NP that means all problems are solvable in polynomial time
#
# NP problem is NP-complete if all problems in NP reduces to it. SAT is NP-complete problem because all other problems reduces to it
# SAT problem captures diffuculty of whole class NP.
# Poly-time algorithm for SAT exists iff P=NP
# No poly-time algorithm for some NP problem -> non for SAT
