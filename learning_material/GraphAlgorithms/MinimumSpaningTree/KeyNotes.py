1. all spanning trees have exactly V-1 edges by Theorem B.2.
Definitions:
cut in graph is a partition of its vertices into two non-empty sets
crossing edge connects a vertex in one set with the vertex in another
Cut property: given any cut, the crossing edge of min weight is in MST
Having a cut we color the shortest edge in black. Now we going to do the next cut. The next cut shouldn't be
crossing black edges
